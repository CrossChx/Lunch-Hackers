# Lunch-Hackers

# Summary
There are two problems each week that the group will try to solve for the next Friday.
We go through our solutions one by one for the group to explain and hopefully propagate knowledge.

# Get Started
1. Send your github username to *@steven.angles* so he can add you to the repo.

1. The directory structure should be fairly self explanatory — challenge/author/code

1. Sign up on HackerRank so that you can submit your solutions and verify they’re right. _(optional)_

## Challenges:
Each week there are two, do one or both.
